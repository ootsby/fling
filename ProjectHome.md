Fling is a port of the physaxe 2D physics library for the Monkey language.

Information about Monkey can be found at: http://monkeycoder.co.nz

The physaxe project page is at: http://code.google.com/p/physaxe/

See the QuickStart page for instructions on getting the demo running.

Please note that Fling requires a recent version of Monkey to compile (>V34, I think). At time of writing, the demo version is V30 and won't compile Fling.
